## What is BellaBeatCaseStudy

BellaBeatCaseStudy is my Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. The dataset I am exploring here is the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset was made availabe on Kaggle.com by [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).It is a public domain dataset and contains data from the survey results of 30 Fitbit users. Bellabeat has asked us to analyse this smart device usage dataset to gain insight into how customers are making use of their smart devices. They are asking us to make recommendations based on those insights and improve Bellabeats marketing strategy and then sales performance.
